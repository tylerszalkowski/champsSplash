Hey! Thanks for checking this out for me. The presave link only goes to google for now as I dont have the one I need. 
I can't seem to figure out how to make the footer responive in a good way?? I can make it fit the viewport but it looks like trash and gets really big on small screens. How can I make it stay on one line? I feel like the solution isn't complex, I just can't seem to figure it out no matter what I try. 
The only other issue I'm having is there's a lot of empty space on certain devices toward the bottom. Any advice on how to chop some of that off? For example, when im using the dev tools and i select the Pixel 5, theres a solid chunk of just space there before the footer. 

Please let me know what could be leaner/done better. Open to any and all feedback. But take it easy on me! This is my first ever real project :) <3 
Thanks again!!!
